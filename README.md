# SoilMechanicsHTMLQuizzes

This project was created as a tool for lecturing in Introduction to Soil Mechanics. Lectures that was part of an action called "Solidarity Courses in Civil Engineering" at the department of Civil Engineering(AUTH). The projects contains multiple choice quizzes for theory and some exercises with randomized data for basic calculations and was created to achieve easier memorization of basic soil properties and familiarity with calculations. 

It is my first project in HTML and for now the language is Greek. You can see photos below.
